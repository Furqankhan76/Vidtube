VidTube - Backend for Video Streaming Platform
This project, VidTube, serves as the backend for a video streaming platform. It was built as part of a Code Along from Hitesh Choudhary's course. The project focuses on backend concepts, including API creation, server-side logic, and routing, laying a strong foundation for backend development.

Features
API Endpoints: RESTful APIs for handling video data.
Efficient Routing: Structured routes for various functionalities.
Data Handling: Processing and managing requests and responses.
Scalable Architecture: Organized and modular codebase.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Framework for building APIs and handling routes.
Installation
To set up and run the backend locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Furqankhan76/Vidtube.git  
cd Vidtube  
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install  
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start  
The server will run at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000  
What I Learned
In this project, I deepened my understanding of backend development by:

Creating and structuring RESTful APIs using Express.js.
Managing server-side routing and middleware.
Handling incoming requests and sending appropriate responses.
Debugging and solving challenges encountered during development.
This project improved my backend development skills and provided insights into building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
